Particle.io Standoff spacer

This is a design for a "standoff spacer" that fits between a Gen3 device such as a Boron to the protoboard or carrier board it is fitted to. This spacer accounts for the header male and female heights (11mm) and has a 5mm diameter which is just enough to provide support yet provides a way to secure the board tightly. The mounting holes are M2.5 and the thread goes right through so it can be screwed in from above and below.

Simple but effective!
